// Flags for verilator

// -msg is deprecated in 4.026 (Jan 2020) and replaced by -rule. Use -msg and
// ignore deprecation warnings until we can rely on -rule support. We also rely
// on -Wfuture-DEPRECATED since that warning category didn't even exist prior
// to 4.026. For some reason this needs to be in a pragma comment rather than
// in `verilator_config for -Wfuture-DEPRECATED to affect it.
